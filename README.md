# Tip Calculator Project
The purpose of this tip calculator is to calculate the cost of the meal plus a mandatory sales tax of 10% and the amount of tip the customer chooses.

The program breaks up the following variables:
  - Cost of the meal
  - The 10% sales tax of the meal
  - The amount of tip the customer chooses
  - The updated cost of the meal + sales tax + tip
  - The number of guests present for the meal
  - The amount each guest should contribute towards the meal
  - An option to restart the calculator with different variables
 
 The tip calculator takes the user input to calculate the total cost of the meal plus sales tax, the amount of tip the user wishes, and the amount each guest should pay. This tip calculator also gives the user a chance to input new variables without having to exit the program. This allows the user to see the total bill before committing to a tip amount.
